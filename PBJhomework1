# Peanut Butter Jelly Time!

# First Goal: Create a program that can tell you whether or not you can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

# Second Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you can make a sandwich, how many you can make

# Third Goal: Modify that program to allow you to make open-face sandwiches if you have an odd number of slices of bread ( )

# Fourth Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you're missing ingredients, which ones you need to be able to make your sandwiches

# Fifth Goal: Modify that program to tell you: if you have enough bread and peanut butter but no jelly, that you can make a peanut butter sandwich but you should take a hard, honest look at your life.  Wow, your program is kinda judgy.
